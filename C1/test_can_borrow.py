The method you are testing is:
    can_borrow(item_type, patron_age, length_of_loan, outstanding_fees, gardening_training, carpentry_training)

The data type of each parameter is:
- item_type: string
- patron_age: integer
- length_of_loan: integer
- outstanding_fees: float
- gardening_training: boolean
- carpentry_training: boolean

You can assume that the can_borrow method is already imported into this python module,
so you can call "can_borrow" directly.
